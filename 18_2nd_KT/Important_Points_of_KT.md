**1. Introduction to Knowledge Technology**

*Difference of data, information and knowledge*
>Data: measurements (bit patterns for computers)  
Information: processed data; patterns that are satisfied for given data  
Knowledge: information interpretted with respect to a user's context to extend human understanding in a given area (where we have data)

*Difinition of knowledge tasks and concrete tasks*
>Concrete tasks: mechanically processing data to an unambiguous solution; limited contribution to human understanding  
Knowledge tasks: data is unreliable or the outcome is ill-defined(usually both); computers mediate between the user an the data, where context (for the user) is critical; enhance human understanding.  

*Difinition of structured data, unstructured data and semi-structured data*
>Structured data: conforms to a schema, e.g. database  
Unstructured data: data without regular decomposable structure, e.g. plain text  
Semi-structured data: data which corresponds in part to a schema, but irregular or incomplete or rapidly changing; some important information is unavailable even with the schema.  
In practice, all data is semi-structured.

*Supervised learning*
>Classification: predicting a discrete class  
Regression: predicting a numeric quantity  

*Unsupervised learning*
>Association: detecting associations between features  
Information organisation; Clustering: grouping similar instances into clusters  
Reinforcement learning  
Recommender systems  
Anomaly/outlier detection  

*Some metacharacter in regular expressions*
