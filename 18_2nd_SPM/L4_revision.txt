1.Understand the communication challenge

• How do we communicate? 
• I will pass a message to someone in the front who will then whisper it to the person next to them. You will each repeat it throughout the lecture 
• At the end of the lecture I will ask the person who last received the message to share with us what they heard 
• There is no right or wrong answer – our objective is to see how we communicate a straight forward message

4.Understand a communications plan and how it is used

• A large proportion of a Project Managers time is spent on communication 
• Project Managers use a Communications Plan to assist them in managing and coordinating key communication messages 
• A good project Communication Management Plan: 
– Ensures communications is effective and efficient 
– Allows the Project Manager to be pro-active 
– Set a common understand of what will be done and when 
– Clarifies who is responsible for key items, what will be delivered 

A Communications Management Plan defines: 
• What information will be communicated - detail and format 
• Communication Channel - meetings, email, telephone, web portal, etc. 
• When information will be distributed – frequency of formal and informal comms 
• Who is responsible 
• Communication needs of stakeholders 
• Resources the project will allocate for communication 
• How sensitive or confidential information will be communicated & who will authorise this 
• The flow of project communications

5.Understand key communication considerations

• 58% of communication is through body language
• 35% of communication is through how the words are said
• 7% of communication is through content or words that are spoken
• Pay attention to more than just the actual words
• A person’s tone or voice and body language can say a lot about how they really feel
• Non verbal comms govern how other people feel about us and also how we feel about ourselves

• Rarely does the receiver interpret a message exactly as the sender intended 
• Geographical location and cultural background affect the complexity of communications 
–Different working hours 
–Language barriers 
–Different cultural norms

• Determine if Meeting Can Be Avoided 
• Define the Purpose and Intended Outcome 
• Determine Who Should Attend the Meeting 
• Provide an Agenda [before the meeting] 
• Prepare any Handouts or Visual Aids 
• Control the meeting – Focus discussions on agenda topics 
• Set Ground Rules – Only one person at a time talking 
• Summarise actions, dates, owners and next steps as you go – via an Action Register 
• Follow up formally with scheduled activities to ensure progress

Conflict is the single most undermanaged activity and if left unresolved will destroy a project. 
• Key causes within a Project 
– Schedule
