1.Understand motivation

• Motivation is derived from the word ‘motive’ 
• It is the driving force within individuals that propels them into action

Money, praise, promotion

2.Understand organisational theory and how people are motivated

Organisational Theory
Organisational theory consists of approaches to organisational analysis. Organisations are groups of individuals that are structured and managed to meet a need, or to pursue collective goals.
Some well used approaches: 
• Maslow Hierarchy of Needs 
• Hertzberg

Maslow Hierarchy of Needs: see L3: page 31
• Proposed by Abraham Maslow in 1943 and still widely used today
• A key tool used by managers in how individuals are motivated
• Focuses on a 5 tier model of human needs
• Describes humans are motivated to achieve certain needs
• Needs take precedence over others and the basic needs must be more or less met before higher needs
• Individual behaviour is multi-motivated and stimulated by more than one need

Hertzberg Two Factor Theory: see L3: page 32
• Proposed by Fredrick Hertzberg in 1959 and still widely used today
• Asked people to describe situations when they felt really good and really bad about their jobs
• There are a set of factors in the workplace that cause satisfaction
• And a separate set of factors that cause dissatisfaction 
• Remedying the causes of dissatisfaction will not create satisfaction
• Adding the factors of job satisfaction eliminate job dissatisfaction

Comparing Maslow & Hertzberg Theories? see L3: page 33

3.Understand how leaders lead and managers manage

• Leadership is the ability to influence and direct people to achieve a common goal 
• Management is the process where resources are used and decisions made in order to achieve the goal 
• Leaders will inspire and motivate people to meet the goal 
• Managers will set objectives and decide how achieve them 
• Project Managers will need to be both Leaders & Managers

Power:
Referent: based on followers' identification and liking for the leader. a schoolteacher who is adored by her students has referent power
Expert: based on followers' perceptions of the leader's competence. a tour guide who is knowledgeable about a foreign country has expert power
Legitimate: associated with having status or formal job authority. a judge who administers sentences in the courtroom exhibits legitimate power
Reward: derived from having the capacity to provide rewards to others. a supervisor who gives rewards to employees who work hard to using reward power.
Coercive: derived from having the capacity to penalize or punish others. a coach who sits players on the bench for being late to practice is using coercive power.

Influence:
1. Authority: Legitimate hierarchical.
2. Assignment: Perceived ability to influence future work assignments.
3. Budget: Perceived ability to authorise use of funds.
4. Promotion:Ability to improve workers position
5. Money:Ability to increase a workers pay & benefits
6. Penalty:Ability to cause punishment. 
7. Work Challenges:Ability to assign work to individuals.
8. Expertise: Perceived special knowledge that others deem / think is important.

5.Understand why we use teams and their value
What is a Team
• An individual is a person with a unique set of skills 
• A Group is a collection of people working together who do not necessarily work collectively toward the same goal 
• A Team is two or more individuals consciously working together to achieve a common objective 
• A Group becomes a Team when members demonstrate a commitment to each other and to the end goal toward which they are working

Why Teams
1.Few individuals possess all the knowledge, skills, and abilities needed to accomplish all tasks.
2.Complementary teamwork skills are one of the most commonly required skills in the work environment.
3.Substantial benefits to the organisation and to the team members.
4.Shared accountability increases likelihood of success.

Benefits 
1. Enhanced Opportunities: Individuals & organisation.
2. Greater Productivity: Leverage the strengths and skills of the collective group.
3. Increased Ownership & Accountability: Multiple people collectively owning the activity and the outcome.
4. More Creativity and Innovation: Individuals build upon one another’s ideas with solutions going beyond one person’s vision of what’s possible.
5. Greater Joy and Satisfaction Among Team Members: A space for people to socialise, connect and be part of something bigger.
6. Broader Perspective: Ability to leverage the collective perspective of all team members.
7. Increased Representation: Involvement of multiple stakeholders groups and their input.
8. Increased Equality: Individuals across all levels can more freely offer their ideas, knowledge and concerns.
9. More Dialogue: Teams offer a site where people can voice their feelings, disagreements, opinions and ideas.

6.Understand how teams form and perform

Tuckman’s Team Development Model
• First proposed by Bruce Tuckman in 1965 
• Elegant and simple explanation of team development 
• Initial model focused on 4 stages Forming–Storming–Norming- Performing 
• Tuckman stated that all phases are necessary and inevitable if a team is to grow, face up to challenges, tackle problems, find solutions, plan work and deliver results 
• He found that it was critical for team to go through an Adjourning stage which was added in the 70’s

see L3: page 53

• As teams develop maturity and ability – leadership styles change and behaviors change
• Tuckman also found that Team Effectiveness changed over time with the team experiencing initial decline in performance after Stage 1 – Forming

forming->storming->norming->performing->adjourning

Positive signs 
• Clear communication

• Consensus among team members 
• Problem solving done by the group 
• Commitment to the project outcomes and the other team members

• Team members work alone, rarely sharing information and offering assistance 
• Blame for what goes wrong, no one accepts responsibility

• Frequently absent impacting time and creating additional work for other

7.Understand team structures

Controlled Centralised see L3: page 58
• Leader coordinates tasks and directs work 
• Communication and Control are vertical 
• Sub-teams with leaders to direct and guide sub-groups

Controlled Decentralised see L3: page 59
• Leader coordinates tasks 
• Sub-teams with leaders 
• Communication horizontal Control is vertical 
• Problem solving  is a team task

Democratic Decentralised see L3: page 60
• No permanent leader 
• A coordinator is appointed for short durations 
• Communication and Control are horizontal

SWAT Team see L3: page 61
• No permanent leader 
• A highly specialised team 
• Put together for a particular tasks e.g. 
- Build a prototype, - Production problem

Scrum Team see L3: page 62
• Used in Agile

8.Understand the advantages and disadvantages of teams
